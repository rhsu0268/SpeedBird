# SpeedBird

This project consists of a series of AI search algorithms used to find the optimal flight given a set of criteria.
It's an important aspect of daily life because when we travel or go on vacation, we usually have a set of 
criteria that we have when we look for our optimal flight. This can be the distance, the price of the ticket, airport quality, or food, and etc. 

Two search algorithms that were used in this project are the following:

1. Uniform-Cost Search
2. A* Search
